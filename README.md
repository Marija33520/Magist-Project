Recommended template for your README files: Not sure jet which one to choose. Still new at this.
# Project Reflection Template -- Also not sure jet ...
## Smmary: 
--BUSINESS DECISION ON Magist Business Proposal, numerical points on why we feel it is not a good idea to merge with them.

## Languages and Libraries Used
--Programing language is SQL and Tableau. No libraries. Project presentation was in GOOGLE SLIDES.


## Key Learnings
We have practices SQL coding by importing Magist database in our SQL program, in order to answer the important business question like revenue, trafic, delivery dates, delays and customer satisfaction.
Later on, that data was filtered through Tableau and formed into Graphs, which we used to create our decisions and prepare Google slide presentation.


## Challenges Overcame
Exporting data from SQL and importing them into Tableau was challenging. We had support from our Instructor, in order to understand what is important to upload and how to filter the data.
Database was too large and the graphs looks quite unreadable, so we had to narrow down the data we wanted to process in order to get more readable charts.

## Additional Reflections
I have learned how to process data, filter whats is important, and sum up the mosta important data that gives us short and correct answers in order to make a decision on a business deal.
